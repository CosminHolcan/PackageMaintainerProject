# PackageMaintainerProject

This web application was developed by me and other two faculty colleagues. It is a simple application with CRUD operations between 2 instances : packages and their maintainers. It was written in Java for backend, using technologies like Spring and Hibernate, and frontend side was developed in Angular.
